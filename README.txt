Here is my finished code challenge.

What you will find in the project is mix of JQuery and vanilla JS. 

			--About the Code--  
 
--Modals are pure CSS  --NO Bootstrap!--

--I used an external mediaQuery file to keep things clean. With a little more time I would have had this page 
fully responsive. There are a couple weird jumps here and there...:\

--Used JQuery for draggables, filtering effects, transitions and basic ordering pop-up

--Used vanilla JS to create objects that stored my data so I could retrieve later

-- Created local and global variables to store data.

 This was a fun project. It really helped me dial in certian techniques. Hopefully, it demonstrates what I can learn
 along the way and bring to a team.

Thanks for the project,
Marc
